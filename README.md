# Landing
This is a HTML/CSS project for an example product landing page.

# Running Tests
In order to run the tests provided by Free Code Camp, you must be using Google Chrome, for now.

To run the tests:
* Click the 3 lines in the top left corner of the page.
* From the drop down list, select Product Landing Page.
* Click `Run Tests`.

For this test it gives a couple of errors for me:
* `11. Within the form, there is a submit <input> with corresponding id="submit".`
  - I am using a button tag instead of input tag.
* `My product landing page should have at least one media query.`
  - I do have at lease one media query.
* `My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.`
  - I do use flexbox at least once.

# Deployment
You can deploy technically as a PHP application because I am using index.php file to point to my index.html file.

# Built With
* HTML
* CSS
